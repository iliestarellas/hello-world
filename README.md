Hi Hi, fellow coders, designers, creative minds!
My friends call me ily. I majored in Visual Communications in College but dropped out my last semester to take a Textile design job for a major fashion line. After a year, I decided I wanted to take my life in a semi- different dirction by teaching myself coding and hopefully in the near future, become self employed! I am a bartender, Graphic/textile designer, soon to be coder and nacho entusiast!
